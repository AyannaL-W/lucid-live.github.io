              Our technology strives to provide a state-of-the-art virtual reality experience accessible for everyone.
              The team has engineered an entirely wireless headset, making for easy portability and storage.
              The headset has an ergonomic and comfortable design for either short or long sessions.
              Headset includes a 4K display and 4D stereo sound, so you have the specifications of a high-end headset with a lightweight design.

              Our applications are primarily designed to tailor experiences based on user reactions to intensify immersion.
              With our revolutionary brain signal scanning technology, the headset converts your thoughts into inputs within the software.
              Removing the physical limitations of a controller makes for the most intuitive interface and controls imaginable (literally).

              Other headsets require external hardware to run, on top of setting up sensors to detect motion.
              We included everything necessary to use the headset, motion controls are optional.
              Anyone can pick up and play, no controllers, sensors or other accessories required!

              With Lucid-Live, when you're connected to the headset, all you need is your mind to enter an alternate reality.
